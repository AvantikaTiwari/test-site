        You can start using the Google Fonts API in just two steps:
        Add a stylesheet link to request the desired web font(s):
        
        
        <link rel="stylesheet"
        href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Font+Name">
        Style an element with the requested web font, either in a stylesheet:
        
        
        .css-selector {
        font-family: 'Font Name', serif;
        }
        or with an inline style on the element itself:
        
        
        <div style="font-family: 'Font Name', serif;">Your text</div>
        -->
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: serif;
            font-size: 48px;
        }

        /*text-shadow: 4px 4px 4px #aaa;-->*/
    </style>
    <link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet" />

myHeading.textContent = "Hello world!";
This is doing the same job as the <link> element for CSS.
        It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).
    The reason the instructions (above) place the <script> element near the bottom of the HTML file is that the browser reads code in the order it appears in the file.

If the JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect the HTML that hasn't loaded yet, there could be problems. 
Placing JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page is one way to accommodate this dependency.
The heading text changed to Hello world! using JavaScript. You did this by using a function called querySelector() to grab a reference to your heading, and then store it in a variable called myHeading. This is similar to what we did using CSS selectors. When you want to do something to an element, you need to select it first.

Following that, the code set the value of the myHeading variable's textContent property (which represents the content of the heading) to Hello world!.

<!--The line <img src="" alt="My test image"> is the HTML code that inserts an image into the page.
We need to tell the HTML where the image is. The image is inside the images directory, which is in the same directory as index.html. 
To walk down the file structure from index.html to our image, the file path we'd need is images/your-image-filename. 
For example, our image is called firefox-icon.png, so the file path is images/firefox-icon.png.-->
